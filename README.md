## About <a name="About"></a>

The general purpose of this website is to give the opportunity to people to improve their concentration and challenging their visual memory while having fun. And this anytime, anywhere as this game is available on various devices as desktops, tablets and mobile.

**Match the memory** is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on the screen and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. If the cards match they fade if not they flip back. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. Once all cards are matched, a popup message appears and congratulates the player for winning the game round. The popup gives the result, how much time and how many moves it took to end the game round. The game ends when the player complete the 3 levels.

The goal is to match all the cards together and win the game round.

1. Click on the Match the memory button. Enter your username and start playing.

2. Click on two cards, if they match, look for another pair of cards. If cards don't pair, try again.

3. Keep matching up pairs until all cards are matched and faded.

4. If there is an issue during the game, just hit the restart button on the right corner of the game.
 If you want to start over, hit the exit button on the right corner of the game.

5. Once you matched all cards together. Congrats you win!
An popup window appears showing your result, time and moves to complete the game round.

6. In the result popup, you can hit 'Level up!' to have another go at the level up game, keep playing for the minimum of moves in the minimum of time.

7. When the player complete the 3 levels, a popup invite him to start the game over by hitting 'Play again!'.

8. Good luck and may the best fan win!

### Why this project? <a name="WhyThisProject"></a>

This project is part of my [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Software Development studies, the **Interactive Front-End Development** module. The objective of this milestone project is the presentation of interactive data. "In this project, you'll build an interactive front-end site. The site should respond to the users' actions, allowing users to actively engage with data, alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals."

For this project we could choose from one of the following ideas:
- Bring your own idea(s) to life, based on providing value to users to address a specific real or imagined need.
- Create a site that calls on the Google Maps API and/or the Google Places API (or similar) to allow users to search for their next holiday destination.
- Build a memory game (for inspiration [Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)) and [Bop It](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bop_It))

I have decided to create a game using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4, JavaScript and jQuery based on visual memory.

### Design <a name="Design"></a>

When it comes about digital memory games it means potentially spending a long time on the screen playing so the design has to be eye-catching, user-friendly, peaceful and relaxing with vibrant but harmonious colors, straightforward and simple to boost concentration and memory.
This is why I have designed my entire project around the **Urban art** and **Abstract art**.

I choose an abstract peaceful [multicolored illustration](https://www.pexels.com/photo/photo-of-multicolored-illustration-2832382/) as background combined to a [colorful work of art](https://www.pexels.com/photo/city-art-los-angeles-street-art-2334805/) visible in Los Angeles streets as card illustration covers.    

I picked the [blue color](https://placehold.it/15/0000FF/0000FF) reminiscent of the same color in the [abstract background](https://www.pexels.com/photo/photo-of-multicolored-illustration-2832382/) for displaying the information badges and the reset and exit buttons.

I chose the combination of [purple](https://placehold.it/15/1f1740/1f1740) and [gold](https://placehold.it/15/DAA520/DAA520) reminiscent of the same colors in the [abstract background](https://www.pexels.com/photo/photo-of-multicolored-illustration-2832382/) for showing the start menu and the results menu.

I picked a Google Font [Sedgwick Ave Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sedgwick+Ave+Display) which emphasizes the Urban art concept with a graffiti style writing font.

I did not add any sound effects on purpose in this version of the game which the general purpose is memory and concentration as I believe sounds can disturb concentration.
Sound effects will possibly be part of a future version with the option to mute them.

#### Framework <a name="Framework"></a>

Bootstrap 4 - Because I've already used Bootstrap and I liked it, because it meets the project requirements "*Incorporate a structured layout*". I've decided to build this game with Bootstrap 4.

#### Color Scheme <a name="ColorScheme"></a>

In keeping with the **Urban art** and **Abstract art** idea, I have chosen a colorful scheme. I first choose my background image, an abstract peaceful [multicolored illustration](https://www.pexels.com/photo/photo-of-multicolored-illustration-2832382/) and then the [colorful work of art](https://www.pexels.com/photo/city-art-los-angeles-street-art-2334805/). I really liked the [gold](https://placehold.it/15/DAA520/DAA520) which fits harmoniously with my background. From there, I used a color calculator to get complementary colors to match my [gold](https://placehold.it/15/DAA520/DAA520). I did not choose the exact complementary colors suggested [here](https://www.sessions.edu/color-calculator-results/?colors=daa520,7020da) and [here](https://www.sessions.edu/color-calculator-results/?colors=daa520,ce20da,2038da) but some derived [html colors](https://www.hexcolortool.com/) based on the color calculator suggestions which work with my background:

- ![#fafafa](https://placehold.it/15/fafafa/fafafa) `#fafafa`
- ![#0000](https://placehold.it/15/0000/0000) black
- ![#1f1740](https://placehold.it/15/1f1740/1f1740) `#1f1740`
- ![#DAA520](https://placehold.it/15/DAA520/DAA520) GoldenRod
- ![#0000FF](https://placehold.it/15/0000FF/0000FF) Blue
- ![#d39e00](https://placehold.it/15/d39e00/d39e00) `#d39e00`

#### Icons <a name="Icons"></a>

- [Font Awesome 5.12](https://fontawesome.com/)
 - I like the look of the Font Awesome's icons which fit my needs for this project.

#### Typography <a name="Typography"></a>

- I have opted to use the Google Font [Sedgwick Ave Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sedgwick+Ave+Display) which emphasizes the Urban art concept with a graffiti style throughout the application. As a secondary font I have imported the simple and easy to read Google Font [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto).

### Wireframes <a name="Wireframes"></a>

I have used [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) for my wireframes because:
- Code Institute have provided all students a free licence until end of 2020. I got to use this software a few year ago and I am pretty happy to get the chance to use it again.
- The simplicity, rapidity and ease of use by focusing on structure and content.

My wireframes for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/sctlcd/match-the-memory/tree/master/app/assets/wireframes) in the wireframes sub-directory.

My Balsamiq Wireframes are not updated according to the latest version. The free licence provided by Code Institute has expired.

- Edge v.89.0
- Firefox v.86.0
- Safari v.5.1.7 for Windows 10
- Opera v.74.0
- Internet Explorer v.11

|All pages | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Safari | Opera | IE |
| :--- | :--- | :---| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Expected appearance | Good | Fair | Good | Poor | Good | Poor |
| Expected responsiveness | Good | Good | Good | Poor | Good | Poor |

- IE: Some CSS3 properties and HTML5 elements are not fully supported

- Safari v.5.1.7: It’s an outdated version and lacks many of the features present in the latest version of Safari. The last version of Safari for Windows was released on May 9, 2012.

### Testing left <a name="Testingleft"></a>

- There is no way to install the latest version of the Safari browser on Windows 10 as Apple stopped developing Safari for Windows operating system long ago.
